# Visual Objects

This sample application consists of two services, front-end and back-end. You can use this sample to deploy and scale services independently in Mesh. For trying upgrades, the `worker` service has an alternate docker file `rotate.dockerfile`, which will build a version of the service causing the object to rotate.
